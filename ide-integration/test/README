Test Steps for testing idle integration
---------------------------------------

N.B. this test script is not expected to test all of bicyclerepairman
- the pyunit tests do that. It is merely there to test the integration
with idle (which doesnt get tested by pyunit).


------------- Rename * -----------------------------------------

- Load scrap.py

- Rename Class to MyRenamedClass
     (Check it renames the class)

- Undo the rename

- Create scrap3.py, containing the following:

---------------------------
import scrap

a = scrap.MyClass()
a.myMethod()
--------------------------

- Go back to scrap.py and rename the method to MyRenamedMethod
     (Check that it prompts for rename in scrap2.py - rename the
     first, but not the second)
	 (Check that it renames all the methods in scrap2.py and scrap3.py
	 except for the one you said no to)

- Undo the rename
     (Check that it undid all the renamings in all the files)

------------- Find References ----------------------------------


- Goto scrap.py, select 'find references'. Check that it tells you to
highlight a class/function/method.

- Highlight 'myMethod' and try again Check that it displays a list of
references to this method.


------------- Find Definition ----------------------------------

- Goto scrap2.py, click 'myMethod' on d.myMethod(), then select 'find
definition'. Check that it displays both the myMethod in MyClass and
in AnotherClass.


- Goto scrap2.py, click 'myMethod' on e.myMethod(), then select 'find
definition'. Check that it takes you to the definition, and doesn't
display a list of myMethod() references.


------------- Extract Method / Function ------------------------

- Load extractMethod.py into idle

- select 'Extract Method' without first selecting a region
      (Check that it tells you to select the region)

- Use extractMethod to extract the marked line from the function

- Use extractMethod to extract the lines of code from the method

- Undo the extract Method

- Undo the extract Function

- Undo again - confirm that a dialog box pops up telling you the stack
is empty.


------------- Extract / Inline local variable ------------------

- Load extractMethod.py into the ide

- In the function 'inlineVariableTest', extract the marked code into a
variable

- Inline the variable back into the code

----------------------------------------------------------------

- exit from the ide, and delete scrap3.py from the directory
