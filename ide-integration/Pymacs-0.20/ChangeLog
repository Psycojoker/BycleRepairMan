	(pymacs-defuns): Use pymacs-defun.

	* pymacs.el (pymacs-start-services, pymacs-round-trip): Recognise

	* pymacs.el (pymacs-round-trip): Check for vanishing helper process.
	(pymacs-serve-until-reply): Get text without catching errors, than

	If it occurs, get out of program, do not keep returning errors.
	Reported by Carey Evans.

	* pymacs.el (pymacs-round-trip): If point coincides with marker,
	just keep it that way as the buffer grows.

	* pymacs.el (pymacs-start-services): If the hash table already
	exists, inform the Python side of IDs that it should not reuse.

	Use `post-gc-hook' if available, instead of using a timer.
	Reported by Gerd Möllman.

2001-09-09  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>
