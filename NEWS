Main highlights of each new version. See ChangeLog for a more detailed
description of changes.

Version 0.9
-----------

This version removes the requirement to load files into
bicyclerepairman before refactoring. Instead, it searches the
PYTHONPATH (and the path in which the file being queried is in). This
allows 'findDefinition' queries to be made on references
(e.g. classes, methods) where the definition is in the python library.


Version 0.8
-----------

This release improves on the internal type-deduction engine to handle
variables and attributes. To reflect this, 'rename' now works on
variables and attributes, in addition to methods, functions and
classes. This release also adds vim support (thanks to Marius Gedminas
and Matt Yeates for this)

Version 0.7
-----------

This release includes a totally re-written type querying engine, which
is much faster and paves the way for new refactorings. It also adds
the 'FindReferences' and 'FindDefinition' query to emacs and idle. 


Version 0.6
-----------

This release adds undo functionality to the mix, and beefs up the idle
and emacs integration so that code is automatically imported into brm
when you load a file into a buffer.


Version 0.5
-----------

This release adds the ExtractMethod refactoring


Version 0.4
-----------

This release adds support for IDLE (see README.idle), and fixes a few
bugs. The CLI and GUI interfaces are now deprecated and have been
removed from this release.



Version 0.3
-----------

This release adds the RenameClass and RenameFunction refactorings.
It also contains the initial xemacs integration functionality (see
README.xemacs).



Version 0.2
-----------

This release adds a simple GUI for renaming methods - run bikegui.py
after installation.

There's also some upgrades to pyxmi. It should now be able to generate
xmi to model all generalizations (including cross-package ones).
N.B. pyxmi.py is now called py2xmi.py. See changelog for reasons!



Version 0.1
-----------

This is the first release of Bicycle Repair Man. It requires python
version 2.2 and above.

This version supports a partial implementation of the RenameMethod
refactoring through a command line interface. 

It automatically renames the method and references to the method that
it can deduce. It asks you about method references it can't deduce the
instance type of.

This software should be considered alpha, and may damage your source
files - backup your sources before use!

See INSTALL for installation and usage instructions.


N.B. This package also contains pyxmi - a little python -> xmi tool I
cobbled together out of the bicycle repair man parsing package. It
generates an xmi file out of a source-file or package-structure,
suitable for loading into the argouml tool. See
http://argouml.tigris.org.
